1. Android device will send an aadhar no.

2. DB in the backend --> This database will contain the registered mobile numbers against each aadhar number.

3. The aadhar number which was sent by the android device will be checked against this database and then if a registered mobile number is found, an otp will be generated by the backend and sms'ed to that mobile number. The otp also needs to be stored in the database since we need to verify it later.

4. Now, the android device on receiving the otp, will enter the otp in the end and the app will send the otp to the backend. The back end will check whether the sent otp is the correct one. If it is correct, a session will start and the backend will also send back the details of all the mobile numbers connected against this aadhar number.

5. The session will end when the user clicks on logout in the front end.
